Build me a full-featured, production-ready WordPress real estate website for my team, "Shoreline Realty Group" in St. Petersburg, Florida, hosted on Hostinger. I want the site to generate inbound leads automatically.

Include and configure the following:

Theme & Design

Use a fast, SEO-optimized theme (e.g., Astra or Kadence).

Mobile-first, modern design with beachy, clean aesthetic. Use shades of slate gray and soft blue for branding.

Home page includes hero section with headline, CTA, featured listings, and recent blog posts.

IDX Integration

Add and configure a WordPress IDX plugin like iHomeFinder or Realtyna (SEO-optimized).

Display property search on homepage and dedicated listings page.

Forms should email responses and save leads to a backend database or connect to Zapier.
